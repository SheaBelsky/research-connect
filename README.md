## About
Large universities have so many research opportunities, but few ways to find out about them. Research Connect is a platform where students can find opportunities and research labs can find students they’re looking for. Instead of having to email researchers, we streamline the process by showing undergrads all of the opportunities available to them.Find out exactly what requirements a lab is searching for that match your background. Search for faculty across all departments to find out who is conducting research and whether they’re looking for students.

​
## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have the ability to modify the repository here https://github.com/cornell-dti/research-connect
2. Open up terminal/command prompt and cd into wherever you want the project folder.
3. Do git clone https://github.com/cornell-dti/research-connect.git to get the latest version of the website
cd into the directory of the project  (probably cd research-connect)
4. Do npm install to install all the node packages
5. Do cd src and then npm install again to install the packages for the front-end
6. Ask a teammate for the .env file (it contains all the passwords so it's not safe to post it here), and add it to the research connect folder right next to app.json. Make sure to call it .env
7. Do cd.. to be in the top level of the project and then run npm run start:dev
8. Put localhost:3001 in your browser address bar and click enter, and the website should pop up

## Dependencies & Libraries
 * **[Example Library](http://example.com)** - **Why we use this library**
 * [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) - a Google Library containing lots of helpful classes for Java. Most notably, immutable data structures (like ImmutableList) and EventBus, which provides a way for classes that do not have references to each other to communicate.
